# Deployment

`loushy build` turns an [agent spec file](../concepts/declarative-specs) into a deployable artifact for one target platform:

```bash
npx loushy build --target=<target> --agent=agent.yaml [--out=<dir>]
```

It runs the target's adapter through three steps - **scaffold** (write the entrypoint and platform files into `--out`, default `.loushy/build/<target>`), **build** (bundle with `tsup`) and **describe** (print the command to run or deploy the result). `tsup` must be installed (`npm install --save-dev tsup`).

| Target              | Output                                                              | Printed command                                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `node-server`       | `server.ts`, `agent.config.js`, `package.json`, `dist/server.js`      | `node dist/server.js`                                                       |
| `docker`            | everything `node-server` writes, plus `Dockerfile`                    | `docker build -t loushy-agent . && docker run -p 3000:3000 loushy-agent`   |
| `cloudflare-worker` | `worker.ts`, `agent.config.js`, `wrangler.toml`, `dist/worker.js`     | `wrangler deploy`                                                            |

Every target serves the same HTTP API as `loushy dev`:

- `GET /health` - `200 ok`
- `POST /chat` - JSON `{ "message": "..." }` in, the agent's `ExecutionResult` (from `AgentExecutor.execute()`) out. Bodies over 1MB are rejected with `413`.

## `node-server`

`dist/server.js` is a single self-contained bundle (the SDK and its dependencies are included), so it runs without `npm install`:

```bash
cd .loushy/build/node-server
node dist/server.js                            # http://127.0.0.1:3000
node dist/server.js --port=8080 --host=0.0.0.0
```

Like `loushy dev`, it binds to `127.0.0.1` unless you opt in to another interface with `--host=<h>` (or `HOST=<h>`); the port comes from `--port`, `PORT`, or defaults to `3000`. Provider credentials are read from the same environment variables as everywhere else (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, ...).

## `docker`

Reuses the `node-server` scaffold and bundle and adds a `Dockerfile` based on `node:20-slim` that copies `dist/` and runs `node dist/server.js` on port 3000. The image sets `HOST=0.0.0.0` - inside a container the server has to listen on all interfaces for `docker run -p` to reach it. Pass provider credentials at run time:

```bash
cd .loushy/build/docker
docker build -t loushy-agent .
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=... loushy-agent
```

## `cloudflare-worker`

Generates a module Worker (`export default { fetch }`) and bundles it as a browser-platform ES module; the build fails if any `node:` import ends up in `dist/worker.js`. `wrangler.toml` points `main` at `dist/worker.js` with `no_bundle = true`, so exactly the verified bundle is uploaded:

```bash
cd .loushy/build/cloudflare-worker
npx wrangler dev       # local workerd runtime
npx wrangler deploy    # requires a Cloudflare account (`wrangler login`)
```

Workers have no Node.js builtins, so this target currently supports:

- the `mock` provider (real provider SDKs are not bundled into the Worker yet - use `node-server` or `docker` for OpenAI/Anthropic/Ollama/OpenRouter)
- the `current-date` and `day-name` tools (`http` depends on Node networking modules)

`loushy build` rejects a spec that uses anything else, with an error naming the unsupported provider or tool. Provider API keys, once real providers are supported, are read from Worker bindings named `<TYPE>_API_KEY` (`wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY`).

:::note Known limitation
Real provider support (OpenAI/Anthropic/Ollama/OpenRouter) for the Cloudflare Workers target is a tracked, intentionally-deferred follow-up - see the SDK's [README roadmap](https://github.com/LinuxDevil/agent-sdk#roadmap).

## Custom targets

Targets are `DeploymentAdapter` objects (`scaffold`, `build`, `describe`) registered by name with `registerAdapter()`; both `registerAdapter()` and `getAdapter()`/`listAdapters()` are exported from the package root.
